NOTES ON BUILDING STM32-M-City
==============================

First we need a program that blinks all of the GPIO pins on all GPIO
ports.  We are using ChatGPT to piece together libraries from ST who
also make the STM32F411ceu6 MCU we're using.  I only intend on using
CMSIS, but I need some files from the full STM32CubeF4 package that
CMSIS comes with.  I removed the CMSIS folder from my project so that
it would not be duplicated as this might confuse ChatGPT when it is
asked to reference CMSIS files from my github repository.  After
taking this step I updated the #include lines in my main.c file:

#include "STM32CubeF4/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F4xx/Source/Templates/gcc/startup_stm32f411xe.s"
#include "STM32CubeF4/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F4xx/Include/stm32f4xx.h"
